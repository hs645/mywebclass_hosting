## 🔍 What Makes This Course Different?└── CI/CD Automation└── projects/                    # Application deployment examples



### ❌ Most Tutorials:    ├── GitHub Actions Workflows

- Give you commands to copy

- Rush to deployment    ├── Automated Testing    ├── static-site/             # HTML/CSS/JS example**Web Development & Deployment:**

- Add security as afterthought

- Don't explain troubleshooting    ├── Automated Deployment

- Assume prior knowledge

    └── Rollback Capabilities    ├── node-app/                # Node.js + Express example- Domain and DNS configuration

### ✅ This Course:

- **Explains every concept** - No "just run this" commands```

- **Security first** - Lock down before deploying

- **Troubleshooting guides** - When (not if) things break    ├── python-app/              # Python + Flask example- Static site hosting

- **Beginner-friendly** - Assumes zero DevOps knowledge

### Teaching Method    └── react-app/               # React SPA example- Node.js and Python application deployment



**We use the "3-Layer Learning" approach:**---



1. **Concept** - What is this and why does it matter?```- Environment variable management

2. **Implementation** - How do we set it up?

3. **Troubleshooting** - What if it breaks?## 🚦 Getting Started



**Every chapter follows this pattern** so you build:- Log monitoring and debugging

- Theoretical understanding

- Practical skills### Step 1: Prerequisites

- Debugging ability

Read chapters 1-4 to understand what you're building and prepare your local environment.---- Production troubleshooting

## 🚨 Common Questions

**Start here:** [Chapter 1: Introduction](docs/01-introduction.md)

### "Do I need Linux experience?"

**No.** Chapter 2 teaches all the Linux commands you need. We assume you can use a command line (cd, ls) but explain everything else.



### "Will this work on Windows?"### Step 2: Get a VPS## 🔧 Infrastructure Services---

**Yes.** You'll SSH to a Linux server from any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux). Windows users can use PowerShell or WSL.

Sign up for DigitalOcean (or any VPS provider):

### "Is $6/month really enough?"

**Yes.** A 1GB RAM VPS can run multiple small-to-medium applications. We show you how to monitor resources and when to upgrade.- **Recommended:** DigitalOcean Droplet



### "What if I get stuck?"- **Size:** 1-2 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 25 GB SSD

**Every chapter has extensive troubleshooting sections.** Plus common errors are documented with solutions. GitHub Discussions for community help.

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS### Caddy Reverse Proxy## 🚦 Getting Started

### "Can I use AWS instead of DigitalOcean?"

**Yes.** The course uses DigitalOcean for simplicity, but works on any Ubuntu 24.04 VPS (AWS, Linode, Vultr, etc.).- **Cost:** $6-12/month



### "How long does this take?"- **Automatic HTTPS** - Let's Encrypt SSL certificates

**20-30 hours total** spread over 2-3 weeks at a comfortable pace. You can go faster if you're experienced or slower if you're new.

**Free credits:** GitHub Student Pack includes $200 DigitalOcean credit

### "Do I need to finish all chapters?"

**No.** Chapters 1-13 + 16-18 get you to a deployed site. Other chapters add security, databases, and automation. But we recommend all of them!- **HTTP/3 Support** - Latest web protocols**Prerequisites:**



### "Can I deploy [my favorite framework]?"### Step 3: Get a Domain (Optional but Recommended)

**Probably yes.** If it runs in Docker or on Linux, you can deploy it. The course covers Node.js and Python examples, but principles apply to any stack.

- **Registrars:** Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare- **Subdomain Routing** - Route traffic to different apps- Basic command line knowledge

---

- **Cost:** $10-15/year

## 📚 Additional Resources

- **Note:** Can use IP address initially, add domain later- **Security Headers** - XSS, clickjacking protection- A domain name (optional but recommended)

### Official Documentation

- [Ubuntu Server Guide](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs)

- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

- [Caddy Documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/)### Step 4: Follow the Course- $5-10/month for a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)

**Yes.** The course uses DigitalOcean for simplicity, but works on any Ubuntu 24.04 VPS (AWS, Linode, Vultr, etc.).✅ **Portfolio builder** - Impressive for employers- **E-commerce Site** - Online store



### "How long does this take?"

**20-30 hours total** spread over 2-3 weeks at a comfortable pace. You can go faster if you're experienced or slower if you're new.

---## 🤝 Contributing

### "Do I need to finish all chapters?"

**No.** Chapters 1-13 + 16-18 get you to a deployed site. Other chapters add security, databases, and automation. But we recommend all of them!



### "Can I deploy [my favorite framework]?"## 🛠️ Supported TechnologiesThis is an educational platform - students are encouraged to:

**Probably yes.** If it runs in Docker or on Linux, you can deploy it. The course covers Node.js and Python examples, but principles apply to any stack.
